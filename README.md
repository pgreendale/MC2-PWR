# MC2-PWR compact Eurorack 
85TE Modular Case - Powersupply

# Introduction 
This Project is a quick - and Dirty Powersupply, which I designed for my modular Eurorack Case. It is relatvely cheap to bild (<60â‚¬ for parts). 
To keep tings simple, it has a singlelayer design, which can be easily etched at home (i prefer photolithographic etching, big planes could be difficult to be done with toner transfer). 

# Features 
* +- 12V dual Power supply based on Linear regulators 
* common Gate/CV rail can be divided to use two groups with common Gate/CV
* two 1.5A Fuses to protect against overcurrent 
* screwhole with GND connection for shielding backplates if necessary 

# Parts 
* parts are ordered from Reichelt, a BOM is included in files. 

# Disclaimer 
This project was designed for experienced build. Especially the installation the transformer requires educated building of line powered electronics. To keep things safe, I recommend extra fusing the transformer against overheating and overcurrent on the primary side. Building and operating is done on your own risk! 

Please check the supply under load (take i.E. 10W 12V Lightbulbs from cars etc. one from gnd to +12V and one from gnd to -12V)  first before connecting any Eurorack modules to it.
