# MC2-PWR compact Eurorack 
85TE Modular Case - Powersupply

# Introduction 
This Project is a quick - and Dirty Powersupply, which I designed for my modular Eurorack Case. It is relatvely cheap to bild (<60â‚¬ for parts). 
To keep tings simple, it has a singlelayer design, which can be easily etched at home (i prefer photolithographic etching, big planes could be difficult to be done with toner transfer). 

# Features 
* +- 12V dual Power supply based on Linear regulators 
* Common Gate/CV rail can be divided to use two groups with common Gate/CV
* Two 1.5A Fuses to protect against overcurrent 
* Screwhole with GND connection for shielding backplates of necessary 

# Parts 
* Parts are ordered from Reichelt, a BOM is included in files. 

# Disclaimer 
This project was designed for sophisticated build. Especially the installation the transformer requires educated building of line powered electronics. To keep things safe, I recommend extra fusing the transformer against overheating and overcurrent on the primary side. Building and operating is done on own risk!
